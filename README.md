# Networking_ARP_Spoof
This project uses GoLang to read PCAP files and analyze the TCP, IP, Ethernet, and ARP layers to identify the IP addresses that sent more than 3 times as many SYN packets as the number of SYN+ACK packets it received and sent more than 5 SYN packets in total. Prints the MAC addresses that send more than 5 unsolicited ARP replies.
